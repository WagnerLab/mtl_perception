## Retrospective analyses

Folders in this directory correspond to studies that comprise the `retrospective dataset`. Each of these folders (e.g. `barense_2007/`) contain an analysis script (`determine_model_performance.py`) which generates a `model_performance` output file of different formats (`.csv` and `.pickle`) using the model in `model/`. The stimuli and human behavioral results from these original publications are located in `retrospective/experiments`.
