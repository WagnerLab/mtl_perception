## Retrospective analyses

Folders in this directory correspond to studies that comprise the `retrospective dataset`. Each of these folders (e.g. `barense_2007/`) contain an analysis script (`determine_model_performance.py`) which generates a `model_performance` output file of different formats (`.csv` and `.pickle`) using the model in `model/`. The stimuli and human behavioral results from these original publications are located in `retrospective/experiments`.

From the manuscript: 

 > Through a comprehensive literature review we identify published, concurrent visual discrimination studies administered to PRC-intact and -lesioned participants (Methods: Literature Review). Through correspondence with the original authors we acquired a "retrospective dataset" composed of stimuli and behavioral data for 29 experiments that have collectively been used as evidence both for and against the perceptual-mnemonic hypothesis (Methods: Retrospective Dataset). Using one instance of a task-optimized convolutional neural network, we estimate the model's cross-validated fit to previously collected electrophysiological responses, identifying a model layer that best fits high-level visual cortex (Methods: Model Fit to Electrophysiological Data). We use an unweighted, linear decoder off of model responses from this IT-like layer to solve each trial in the retrospective dataset, then compute the average performance across trials for a given experiment (Methods: Model Performance on Retrospective Dataset). Thus, for each experiment in the retrospective dataset, we have a single value corresponding to the averaged performance that would be expected by a linear readout of high-level visual cortex which we refer to here as `model performance.'
