## Retrospective analyses

Each folder in this directory contain a unique analysis script (`determine_model_performance.py`) that generates a `model_performance` output file (either `.csv` or `.pickle`). Stimuli and human behavioral results from the original publications are located in `retrospective/experiments`. `combine_results.py` contains functions to integrate these results across studies.
