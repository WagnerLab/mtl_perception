# statistics and figures 

Main results and figures can be generated by running through `reporting_statistics.ipynb` as a jupyter notebook, after setting the kernal to `mtl_perception`. Results in the [`manuscript/preprint.pdf`](manuscript/preprint.pdf) are generated in this notebook, which integrates results from  other folders: 

- `electrophysiological/reliability_and_fitting_results.pickle`: model-by-layer fits to neural responses in IT and V4
- `retrospective/combine_results.py`: integrates model and human performance across all retrospective datasets
- `high-throughput/human_performance.csv`: item-by-item human performance on novel dataset
- `high-throughput/summary_dataframe.csv`: summary of human and model performance on novel dataset
- `architecture/retrospective.pickle`: performance of multiple architectures on all retrospective datasets  
- `training/retrospective/facetrained_retrospective.pickle`: face-trained model performance on retrospective datasets
- `training/novel/multiple_models_novel_stimuli.csv`: model performance on novel dataset as a function of training

Generating the files above requires the electrophysiological data from [Majaj et al. 2015](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/35/39/13402.full.pdf "Study that collected electrophysiological data used for model validation"), as well as all stimuli used in the retrospective and novel datasets. These data are not included, but can be provided upon request.
