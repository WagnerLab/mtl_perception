## When the ventral visual stream is not enough: A deep learning account of medial temporal lobe involvement in perception

The structure of this repository reflects the main findings in the manuscript `summary/manuscript/preprint.pdf`. A brief discription of the folder/analysis structure: 

- `electrophysiological/`: fit models to electrophysiological recordings from the VVS and identify IT-like layer  
- `retrospective/`: generate model performance in the retrospective dataset
- `high-throughput/`: collect human behavior online in novel dataset and preprocess the results 
- `in_silico/`: examine effects of changing model architecture and trained data on PRC-relevant behavior 
- `summary/`: reporting statistical effects, generating figures, and final manuscript
