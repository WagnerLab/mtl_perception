## When the ventral visual stream is not enough: A deep learning account of medial temporal lobe involvement in perception

To create the python environment used to generate and analyze all data in the current repository, install conda (v4.8.5, tested on an osx-64 platform) and run the following command in the current directory:

```
$ conda env create -f conda_environment.yml
```

The structure of this repository reflects the main findings detailed in the manuscript `summary/manuscript/preprint.pdf`. A brief discription of the folder/analysis structure: 

- `electrophysiological/`: fit models to electrophysiological recordings from the VVS and identify IT-like layer  
- `retrospective/`: generate model performance on all experiments in the  retrospective dataset
- `high-throughput/`: collect human behavior online on  novel dataset and preprocess the results 
- `in_silico/`: examine effects of changing model architecture and trained data on PRC-relevant behavior 
- `summary/`: reporting statistical effects, generating figures, and final manuscript 

The electrophysiological data and stimuli used for the modeling work are not included, but can be provided upon request. Summary statistics and figures can be generated by opening the jupyter notebook `summary/reporting_statistics.ipynb` and setting the kernal to the conda environment `mtl_perception`. This notebook calls custom functions and results located within other folders (e.g. `retrospective/barense_2007/model_performance.csv`).
